# README

When I started to learn Rails a few years ago I never built a basic blog like lots of tutorials says to do. Now, I want share some content and why not to back to basics and build my own blog from scratch and review some concepts or new things to got updated about Ruby on Rails and stuff?

## Running

To run this code you'll need installed Ruby 2.6 and Postgres. Follow these steps:

* Clone repository
* Run `bundle install`
* Create you postgres user:

```
createuser -sW <your-user> -h localhost      # Enter your password
```
Then, replicate user databse data to `database.yml` file.

Have fun!
